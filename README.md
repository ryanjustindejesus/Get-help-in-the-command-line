- <b>Displaying the man pages for a command</b>
- <b>Finding commands based on keywords about their function</b> 


<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Qwiklabs</b> 

<h2>Lab walk-through:</h2>

<h2>Task 1: Learn more about commands </h2>
In this task, I explored a few commands I can use in the shell to learn more about the functionality of other commands.
 <br/> <br />
(1) First, I used the command "whatis cat" to get a short description of the cat command. <br/> <br />
(2) Finally, I used the command "man cat" to get more details about the cat command.

<h2>Task 2: Explore the useradd command </h2>
In this task, I set the expiration date for a temporary user account. I know that I need to use the useradd command for this, but I'm not quite sure how to complete the task.
<br/> <br />
(1) I used the comman "man useradd" to get more details about the useradd command.

<h2>Task 4: Determine which command to use </h2>
In this task, I need to create a new group but I can’t remember what command to use. I need to identify a command that will do this by searching for it through keywords.
 <br/> <br/> 
(1) I used the command "apropos -a create new group" to determine the most appropriate Linux commands to use
